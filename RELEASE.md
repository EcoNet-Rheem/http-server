# HTTP Server Library

## What's Included?
Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the HTTP server library.

## Known Issues
| Problem | Workaround |
| ------- | ---------- |
| If the HTTP server is stopped while connected to certain clients (such as some browsers), then a duration of approximately 2-3 minutes needs to elapse (TCP wait time) prior to re-starting the HTTP server again (or it could result in socket bind to fail). | None |
| On memory constrained devices (such as CY8CKIT_062_WIFI_BT), there could be a limit on the max number of simultaneous secure connections. | None |
